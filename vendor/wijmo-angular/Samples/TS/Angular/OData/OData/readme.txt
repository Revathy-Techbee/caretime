OData
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shows how do the Wijmo controls work with OData services.

OData is a standardized protocol for creating and consuming data APIs. 
OData builds on core protocols like HTTP and commonly accepted methodologies like REST. 
The result is a uniform way to expose full-featured data APIs. (http://www.odata.org/)

The ODataCollectionView class in this sample extends the CollectionView class
in Wijmo to connect to OData services. The ODataCollectionView class loads
data from OData tables. When the user modifies the view, changes are automatically
applied to the table.

You can use the result objects from the OData service as data sources for any Wijmo controls, 
and in addition to full CRUD support and real-time updates you automatically get 
CollectionView features including sorting, filtering, paging, and grouping.
