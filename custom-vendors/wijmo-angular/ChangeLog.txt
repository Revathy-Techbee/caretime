Build Number 5.20151.48          Build Date: 04/10/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a Control.disabled property (maps to disabled attribute of the host element)
    - Added class names to facilitate custom styling of column headers: 
        wj-sort-asc (column is sorted in ascending order)
        wj-sort-desc (column is sorted in descending order)
        wj-filter-on (column has an active filter)
        wj-filter-off (column has an inactive filter)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.47          Build Date: 04/08/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved FlexGrid cell templates for Angular performance.
    - Changed FlexGrid mouse handler to sort/select on left button only (TFS 114623)
      (reserving the right button for context menus)
* Bug fixes
    - Allow wj-context-menu directive on element level directives.
    - Fixed FlexGrid hit-testing after window resize (TFS 112961)

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.45          Build Date: 04/02/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved grid filter to support value and condition filtering.
    - Added a Menu.isButton property that turns menus into split-buttons.
    - Input and Gauge directives can bind using ng-model directive now, gaining 
      the features specific to ng-model this way.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate.cell-overflow attribute that allows to change
      cells' style.overflow property declaratively.
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance (especially visible in IE).
* Bug fixes
    - columnLayout method did not work properly in IE9/10 (TFS 112895).
    - CollectionView notified before updating tracking arrays, should notify after.
    - Fixed issue with popup width (popups were sometimes wider than they should be).
    - Fixed old scrolling issue with IE and very large grids (100,000+ rows)
    - Fixed issue with hierarchical FlexGrid's (with childItemsPath assigned) Angular 
      cell templates for regular cells that didn't apply to group header cells.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20151.42          Build Date: 03/17/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Optimized grid scrolling performance.
    - Added markers to indicate the position of rows and columns being dragged.
    - Improved behavior of drop-down grid cells on mobile devices.
    - Added select-all functionality when the user clicks the top-left fixed cell.
    - Changed row and column resize cursors to 'col-resize' and 'row-resize.'
    - Added a FlexGrid.deferResizing property to defer row and column resizing until the 
      user releases the mouse.
    - Added a Column.sortMemberPath property to sort columns based on an alternate binding.
    - Exposed wijmo.showPopup and hidePopup utility methods for positioning popup elements.
    - Added support for multi-item selection in the ListBox control. Set the checkedMemberPath 
      property to the name of a Boolean property in the itemsSource collection and the 
      ListBox adds checkboxes to each item, and fires the itemChecked event when
      the current item is checked or unchecked.
    - Deprecated and removed the wijmo.isTouchDevice method. The method
      actually tested the browser, not the device, so it was useless.
    - Added a LineMarker class to the wijmo.chart module that provides FlexChart with a 
      continuous data point information with optional directional lines  
      as mouse pointer moves over a chart surface.
    - Added a wijmo.chart.interaction extension module with a RangeSelector class
      that allows the user to choose the range of data to display on the specified FlexChart.
    - Added WjFlexGridCellTemplate directive for Angular that allows to define
      a custom template for any type of a FlexGrid cell (column and row headers,
      editing cell, and so on).
    - Cell templates now support element level directives.
    - Wijmo child directives for Angular (like WjFlexGridColumn or WjFlexChartSeries),
      when used in conjunction with ng-repeat directive, now support full-functional
      synchronization with ng-repeat's source array, including items order.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed issues related to 'focusout,' which is not supported in FireFox.
    - Fixed FlexGrid.getCellBoundingRect so that it works correctly when dir="RTL."
    - Fixed a problem in chart selection when using itemFormatter.
    - Fixed the Clipboard so that it works on Apple OS (detects the 'Apple' key).
    - HitTestInfo.item returns correct value when chart is bounded to CollectionView.
    - Fixed rendering of merged cells when there are frozen areas (TFS 110627).
    - Fixed handling of IME text in ComboBox when isEditable = false (TFS 108547).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.39        Build Date: 02/23/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added a FlexGrid.sortRowIndex property. This property determines the index of 
      the row in the column headers panel that displays the sort icon and can be clicked
      to sort the column. By default, it is set to null, causing the last row in the 
      panel to be the 'sort row.'
    - Raise editing events when pasting data into the FlexGrid (this allows users to
      prevent overwriting of specific cells when pasting).
    - Improved column filters to work with complex properties (e.g. 'state.name', 'state.pop').
    - Exposed wijmo.Binding class used to work with complex properties.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed several problems with rendering mixed chart types (TFS 96721, 98617).
    - Made pie chart handle negative data values correctly (TFS 89936).
    - Fixed a problem with the pie chart tooltip for the selected slice (TFS 108871).
    - Fixed a problem with chart tooltips in IE11 (TFS 109876).
    - Fixed InputMask cursor positioning on Safari (TFS 109969, 102148, 96927).
    - Fixed aggregate so that it updates correctly after adding new rows (TFS 109119).
    - Improved date/time detection in the FlexGridFilter editor (TFS 109409).
    - Prevented users from dragging rows below the new row template (TFS 109012).
    - Fixed RTL layout so that it works properly in Safari (TFS 109371).
    - Fixed cell templates so that they are honored in GroupRows (regression).
    - Fixed a problem with dropdown controls on mobile browsers.
    - Fixed Wijmo directives for Angular so that they work with the ng-inspector tool.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.37        Build Date: 02/15/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added wijmo.grid.grouppanel module with the GroupPanel control to provide drag&drop
      grouping functionality to the FlexGrid control.
    - Improved the CollectionView sorting logic to place nulls at the bottom of the list,
      regardless of sort direction (Excel behavior).
    - Allow initialization of ObservableArray in constructor.
    - Improved formatting of values in GroupRow node cells.
* Bug fixes
    - The data labels are not visible for data points outside plot area (TFS 109293).
    - Fixed problem with stacked charts when first series has custom chart type (TFS 107530).
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid.autoSizeRows in grids with word-wrapping and merged columns.
    - Fixed problem with disappearing dropdown controls on mobile devices in case of zoomed in
      pages.
    - Fixed problem with Autocomplete in the Android 4.4.2 Browser where typed characters 
      can be swapped.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.35        Build Date: 02/09/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Improved the grouping logic of paged CollectionViews to avoid splitting groups
      between pages and to include all items in aggregates (as opposed to items in
      the current page which was the previous behavior).
    - Added a CollectionView.sortConverter property. The property specifies a function
      that can be used to customize the sorting behavior of the CollectionView.
    - Improved FlexGrid sorting to take dataMaps into account. Now the grid sorts based
      on display value (as opposed to raw data values which was the previous behavior).
    - Expanded grid keyboard handling: now ctrl+home and ctrl+end navigate to the
      first and last cells on the grid (as opposed to home/end, which navigate to the
      first and last cells on the current row).
    - Added Gauge.origin property. This property determines the starting point used
      for painting the pointer range. Setting it to null causes the gauge to use
      the min property or zero if the range extends from negative to positive values.
    - Clamp InputNumber value between min/max as the user types the value in.
    - Improved behavior of input controls on touch devices.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart updating after changing collection (TFS 107253).
    - Fixed problem with FlexPie bound to CollectionView with currentPosition=-1 (TFS 106270).
    - Fixed problem with calculating axis limits in stacked chart with series that has
      custom chart-type (TFS 106988).
    - FlexPie labels rendered correctly when offset > 0 (TFS 105891).
    - Fixed problem with FlexChart axis minor ticks and grid lines (TFS 101264, 101401).
    - FlexChart legend and titles rendered with default text color (TFS 98329).
    - Fixed problem with rendering bubble and financial charts bound to CollectionView.
    - Fixed problem with FlexGrid when selectionMode == ListBox and empty item sources.
    - Fixed positioning of grid filter editor on frozen columns (TFS 105593).
    - Fixed problem with merging cells in group rows with aggregates (TFS 98610).
    - Allow clearing cells pressing Delete when column has map and is not required (TFS 107058).
    - Improved positioning of InputDate dropdown calendar (TFS 102162).
    - Fixed regression with dropdowns not showing in iOS Safari.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.32      Build Date: 01/22/2015
=========================================================================================

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with rendering axis minor ticks (TFS 102152).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.30      Build Date: 01/15/2015
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added support of chart data labels(new properties FlexChart.dataLabel and
      FlexPie.dataLabel).
    - Added wijmo.grid.filter module with FlexGridFilter extension to provide
      Excel-style filtering in grid columns.
    - Added FlexGrid.getCellBoundingRect and GridPanel.getCellBoundingRect methods
      to retrieve the bounds of a given cell.
    - Added FlexGrid.formatItem event to allow multiple subscribers to customize cells
      (itemFormatter allows only one).
    - Added FlexGrid.AutoSizeMode property to customize auto-sizing behavior, as
      well as new events autoSizingColumn, autoSizedColumn, autoSizingRow, autoSizedRow.
    - Improved DropDown control behavior in clipping containers.
    - Added two new glyphs: .wj-glyph-check and .wj-glyph-filter.
    - Child Angular directives for Wijmo (like wj-flex-grid-column) can now be defined using
      the ng-repeat directive.
* Bug fixes
    - Fixed issue with freezing logic in merged cells.
    - Prevent startEditing from working on invisible rows/columns (TFS 100707).
    - Improved selection/sort behavior (TFS 100326).
    - Allow removing boolean values with delete key (TFS 96566).
    - Prevent dragging Group rows and New rows (TFS 88118).
    - Fixed position of drop-down arrows on RTL systems (TFS 97498).

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.26      Build Date: 12/29/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added initialization options to wijmo.grid.Column constructor
    - Changed default color in InputColor and ColorPicker to white
    - Added support of logarithmic axes(new Axis logBase property).

* Bug fixes
    - Disabled cell templates in GroupRow cells
    - Improved freezing logic in GroupRow cells (TFS 98800)
    - Improved event logic in drop-down cells.
    - ng-style applied to the wj-flex-grid-column directive may cause changes in another
      column styles.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.25      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added frozenRows and frozenColumns properties to the FlexGrid.
      Frozen cells are non-scrollable (like header cells) but can be selected and 
      edited (like regular cells).
    - Added Axis properties itemsSource, binding, itemFormatter. 
      The properties provide axis label customization.
    - Added Axis overlappingLabels property that controls appearance
      overlapped labels on axis. By default the overlapped labels are hidden.
    - Added event Axis.rangeChanged. 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.24      Build Date: 12/10/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Added InputColor and ColorPicker controls to wijmo.input module.
    - Added toHsb, toHsl, fromHsb, fromHsl methods to Color class.
    - Improved Globalize.formatNumber to honor the 'd' format as per the .NET spec.
      (e.g. Globalize.formatNumber(-1234, 'D6') == '-001234')
    - Added chart axis minor ticks and grid lines
      ('minorTickMarks', 'minorGrid' props in Axis class).
    - Added wijmo.chart.Axis.origin property
      This property allows to specify axis position inside plot area.
    - Added 'initialized' event and 'isInitialized' boolean property to Angular directives
      and Knockout Bindings. The property gets a true value and event is triggered after
      the directive has finished initialization of the control with values defined in
      its attributes and child directives.

* Bug fixes
    - CollectionView did not raise itemChanged when removing the current item
      and preserving the current position.

* Bug fixes
    - Fixed problem with column/bar width when using x-value data(TFS 97589). 

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.23      Build Date: 11/25/2014
=========================================================================================

* Improvements
    - Removed Wijmo 5 dependency on jQuery.
        Starting with this version, Wijmo 5 has no dependencies on external libraries.
    - Added wijmo.grid.Column.showDropDown property
        This option adds drop-down buttons to cells.
        Clicking the button brings up a list based on the column's dataMap.
        This feature requires the wijmo.input module.

* Bug fixes
    - Improved handling of star-sized columns in auto-sized grids; previously the grid
      could sometimes leave room on the right for a scrollbar that wasn't there.

* Breaking changes
    - Calling the wijmo.grid.DataMap constructor with an itemsSource but no selectedValuePath
      or displayMemberPath parameters used to create integer keys for the values; now the 
      array values are used both as values and as keys; this is more convenient for creating
      lists of strings that can be used with drop-downs and avoids the creation of arbitrary
      (and meaningless) keys.

=========================================================================================
Build Number 5.20143.22      Build Date: 11/11/2014
=========================================================================================

    - added InputMask control (see http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.input.InputMask.Class.html)
    - added Clipboard class (see http://wijmo.com/5/docs/topic/wijmo.Clipboard.Class.html)
    - added 'invalidateAll' static method to Control class.
    - added 'mask' property to InputDate, InputTime controls
    - added 'mask', 'required', 'inputType' properties to FlexGrid.column class
    - added clipboard support in FlexGrid
      ('autoClipboard' prop, 'pasting', 'pasted', 'copying', 'copied' events)
    - added 'rendering' event in FlexChart
    - added multi-axis support to FlexChart 
      ('axisX', 'axisY' props in Axis class and 'axes' collection in FlexChart class)
    - added 'labelAngle' property to chart Axis class.
    - improved on-line help (show/hide inherited members, collapse/expand properties/events/methods).
    - added wijmo.animate method (mainly to avoid dependency on jQuery)

* Bug fixes
    - Could not drag FlexGrid columns one position to the right...
    - Corrected Japanese localization settings in the wijmo.culture.ja.js file.
